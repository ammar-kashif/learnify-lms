## The problem: passive consumption ≠ learning

Most online courses stall out after a few videos. Students “recognize” ideas but can’t **use** them. Real learning requires a loop: attempt → feedback → revision. Assignments are how we operationalize that loop at scale.

## Our design goal: mastery with minimum friction

We asked a simple question: “What would it take for a teacher to post a great assignment in 2 minutes, and for a student to submit in 30 seconds?” Everything in Learnify’s assignment system ladders up to that.

### What a great assignment experience includes

- Clear instructions and success criteria
- One place to view status, due dates, and attachments
- One-click upload from any device (PDF/DOC/DOCX/images)
- Fast, specific feedback and visible grades
- Fairness controls (deadlines, late flags, optional lock after due date)

## What we shipped in Learnify (features that matter)

- **Teacher attachments**: add PDF/DOC/DOCX specs or marking schemes to the assignment itself.
- **Student submissions**: secure S3 storage; links are generated as short‑lived signed URLs.
- **Grading UI**: set a score out of total points, add feedback, and update status instantly.
- **Deadline control**: “Stop submissions after the deadline” is a single checkbox.
- **Student clarity**: visible states — Not Submitted → Submitted → Graded (with `X / total`).
- **Friendly filenames**: downloaded submissions use human‑readable names (not raw S3 keys).

## Technical architecture (for those who care)

- **Data model**: `assignments` and `assignment_submissions` with RLS policies for safety.
- **Storage**: S3 for attachments and submissions; downloads use signed URLs from a secure route.
- **Next.js APIs**: server routes handle creation, listing, grading, and secure file access.
- **Authorization**: only the student owner, assigned teacher, or admin/superadmin can access a submission file.
- **Performance**: we fetch related data (e.g., profiles) in separate queries when FK hints are unreliable, eliminating 500s and hydration pain.

## A simple playbook for teachers

1. Post one assignment per chapter with a short PDF spec attached.
2. Include three things: goal, success criteria, and an example answer sketch.
3. Use generous deadlines early, then add the “stop after due date” control for exams.
4. Give focused feedback (2–3 lines) within 48 hours; it doubles motivation.
5. Allow a single resubmission to drive mastery, not perfectionism.

## Student experience in Learnify

- See all assignments in the course nav — impossible to miss.
- Upload directly (PDF/DOC/DOCX/images) from phone or desktop.
- Get a clear badge: Submitted (with timestamp) → Graded (`score / total`).
- Download your own submission or teacher spec via safe links.

## Analytics that matter (coming next)

- Submission rates per assignment
- Average grade vs. time‑to‑deadline
- Late‑submission flags and resubmission deltas

## SEO note: why this helps discovery

Assignment pages and blog articles like this one create fresh, structured content around real course outcomes. Search engines tend to reward:

- Clear headings and scannable sections
- Specific, non‑generic language tied to user intent
- Stable internal links (course → assignments → results)

## FAQ

**Can teachers attach multiple files?** Yes — PDFs, DOC, and DOCX are supported today; we can add more.

**Are files public?** No. All downloads are served via a secure API that generates signed URLs.

**Can we stop submissions after the deadline?** Toggle the checkbox while creating or editing the assignment.

**Do students see their grade out of total?** Yes — displayed as `score / maxPoints`, along with submission status.

If you lead a course, ship one targeted assignment today. Keep it small, make the success criteria explicit, and provide fast feedback. That’s how watching turns into mastery.
